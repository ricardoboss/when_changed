Runs a Command when a file changes (Windows only)

usage:
when_changed (file path) (command) (optional-parameters)

when_changed C:\somedir\foo.txt myapp.exe
when_changed C:\somedir\*.txt myapp.exe
when_changed C:\somedir\* myapp.exe
when_changed C:\somedir\foo.txt myapp.exe bar wibble 123

Notes:
- Press 'F' to force the command to run.
- The utility will wait for the command to exit before running it again.
- The utility will will re-run the command if file changes whilst command is running.
- Beware of creating an infinite loop!
- (file path) must be a file path with wildcards -- not a directory.
- Search is not recursive (this can easily be turned on in the code).

(Very quick/buggy implementation!
